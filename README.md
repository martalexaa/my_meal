# My Meal App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The "My Meal" app is a web application built using React. It utilizes the Spoonacular API to fetch recipes and display them to users. The app allows users to search for recipes, browse recipes by category, and view popular meals. It provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

The app is deployed to gh-pages.

## Highlights

Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes using the search functionality provided.

Category Browsing: Users can browse recipes based on different categories, such as Italian, American, Thai, and Japanese cuisine.

Popular Meals: The app displays a selection of popular meals using a carousel-style layout.

React Router: The app utilizes the React Router library for handling client-side routing and navigation.

Styled Components: The app uses the styled-components library for styling its components, allowing for dynamic and customizable styles.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes.

## Dependencies

@splidejs/react-splide: A library used for creating the carousel/slider component in the popular meals section.

dotenv: Allows you to load environment variables from a .env file.

framer-motion: A library for adding animations and transitions to React components.

react-icons: Provides a collection of popular icons as React components.

react-router-dom: A library for declarative routing in React applications.

react-scripts: Configuration and scripts for building and running React applications.

styled-components: A popular CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS code within your JavaScript files.

web-vitals: A library for measuring web performance metrics.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
